# QUEBEC app for CIS-486

- App is a library building on a game I built in 376
  - Allows me to store the data generated for as many names as I want

1. Use the iframe of my name app to generate your name data
2. Enter your name data into the library
3. Edit any of the information in the library as you want
   - (choose a different animal!)
4. Delete your record if ya want :(
